## Google Cloud SDK (gcloud) Commands

The Google Cloud SDK (gcloud) offers a variety of commands to interact with different Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services. Here's a quick reference to get you started:

### Compute Engine

**Listing Resources:**

* `gcloud compute zones list`: Lists available zones.
* `gcloud compute instances list`: Lists all VM instances in your project.
* `gcloud compute disks list`: Lists persistent disks.
* `gcloud compute snapshots list`: Lists snapshots of your disks.

**Instance Management:**

* `gcloud compute instances create`: Creates a new VM instance.
* `gcloud compute instances describe`: Gets details of a specific VM.
* `gcloud compute instances stop`: Stops a running VM instance.
* `gcloud compute ssh`: Opens an SSH connection to a VM.

### Cloud Storage

* `gsutil mb gs://bucket_name`: Creates a new storage bucket.
* `gsutil cp local_file gs://bucket_name`: Uploads a file to a bucket.
* `gsutil ls gs://bucket_name`: Lists objects within a bucket.

### Other Services

* `gcloud auth list`: Lists the active GCP account.
* `gcloud config list project`: Shows the current project ID.
* `gcloud kms decrypt`: Decrypts ciphertext using Cloud Key Management Service.
* `gcloud logging logs list`: Lists your project's logs.
* `gcloud sql backups describe`: Gets information about a Cloud SQL backup.

**Note:** This is just a small sample of gcloud commands. For a comprehensive list and detailed explanations, refer to the official documentation: [https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs)


In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the `gcloud` command-line tool is used to manage resources and services. 
Similar to Azure CLI, `gcloud` is essential for performing a wide range of operations within GCP. 
Hereâ€™s a list of some of the most frequently used `gcloud` commands, categorized by their primary functions:

### 1. **Initialization and Configuration**
- `gcloud init`: Initialize, authorize, and configure the `gcloud` tool.
- `gcloud config set project`: Set the default Google Cloud project for commands.
- `gcloud auth login`: Authenticate with Google Cloud.

### 2. **Project Management**
- `gcloud projects list`: List all projects.
- `gcloud projects create`: Create a new project.
- `gcloud projects delete`: Delete a project.

### 3. **Compute Engine (Virtual Machines)**
- `gcloud compute instances create`: Create a new Compute Engine instance.
- `gcloud compute instances list`: List all Compute Engine instances.
- `gcloud compute instances delete`: Delete a Compute Engine instance.
- `gcloud compute ssh`: SSH into a Compute Engine instance.

### 4. **Kubernetes Engine**
- `gcloud container clusters create`: Create a new Kubernetes cluster.
- `gcloud container clusters get-credentials`: Get credentials for a cluster to use with `kubectl`.
- `gcloud container clusters list`: List all Kubernetes clusters.
- `gcloud container clusters delete`: Delete a Kubernetes cluster.

### 5. **Storage and Databases**
- `gcloud sql instances create`: Create a new Cloud SQL instance.
- `gcloud sql instances list`: List all Cloud SQL instances.
- `gcloud firestore databases create`: Create a Firestore database.
- `gcloud storage buckets create`: Create a new Cloud Storage bucket.
- `gcloud storage buckets list`: List all Cloud Storage buckets.

### 6. **Networking**
- `gcloud compute networks create`: Create a new VPC network.
- `gcloud compute firewall-rules create`: Create a firewall rule.
- `gcloud compute networks subnets list`: List subnets within a specific network.

### 7. **IAM & Admin**
- `gcloud iam service-accounts create`: Create a new service account.
- `gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding`: Add IAM policy bindings to a project.
- `gcloud iam roles list`: List available IAM roles.

### 8. **App Engine**
- `gcloud app deploy`: Deploy an application to App Engine.
- `gcloud app describe`: Get information about your App Engine application.
- `gcloud app browse`: Open the current application in a web browser.

### 9. **Big Data and Machine Learning**
- `gcloud ai-platform jobs submit training`: Submit a machine learning training job.
- `gcloud dataproc clusters create`: Create a Dataproc cluster for processing large datasets.

### 10. **Monitoring**
- `gcloud monitoring dashboards create`: Create a new monitoring dashboard.
- `gcloud monitoring dashboards list`: List all monitoring dashboards.

These commands cover a broad spectrum of Google Cloud functionalities, from managing compute resources to configuring network settings and deploying applications. 
Mastery of these commands can greatly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of managing Google Cloud environments.
