Introductory primer
A quick primer for getting started with the gcloud CLI.

Installing the Google Cloud CLI
Install the Google Cloud CLI with these installation instructions.

Flags, arguments, and other wondrous additions
Arguments can be positional arguments or flags:

Positional args: Set after command name; must respect order of positional args.
Flags: Set after positional args; order of flags doesn’t matter.

A flag can be either a:

Name-value pair (--foo=bar), or
Boolean (--force/no-force).
Additionally, flags can either be:

Required
Optional: If an optional flag is not defined, the default value is used
Global flags
Some flags are available throughout the gcloud CLI experience, like:

--help: For when in doubt; display detailed help for a command.
--project: If using a project other than the current one.
--quiet: Disabling interactive prompting (and applying default values for inputs).
--verbosity: Can set verbosity levels at debug, info, warning, error, critical, and none.
--version: Display gcloud version information.
--format: Set output format as config, csv, default, diff, disable, flattened, get, json, list, multi, none, object, table, text, value, or yaml.
Cleaning up results
Get the most from your output with the filter, format, limit, and sort-by flags.

For Compute Engine instances with prefix us and not machine type f1-micro:



gcloud compute instances list --filter="zone ~ ^us AND -machineType:f1-micro"
For a list of projects created on or after 15 January 2018, sorted from oldest to newest, presented as a table with project number, project id and creation time columns with dates and times in local timezone:



gcloud projects list --format="table(projectNumber,projectId,createTime.date(tz=LOCAL))"
--filter="createTime>=2018-01-15T12:00:00" --sort-by=createTime
For a list of ten Compute Engine instances with a label my-label (of any value):



gcloud compute instances list --filter="labels.my-label:*" --limit=10
Understanding commands
The underlying patterns for gcloud CLI commands; to aid self-discovery of commands.

Finding gcloud CLI commands
The gcloud CLI is a tree; non-leaf nodes are command groups and leaf nodes are commands. (Also, tab completion works for commands and resources!)

Most gcloud commands follow the following format:



gcloud + release level (optional) + component + entity + operation + positional args + flags
For example: gcloud + compute + instances + create + example-instance-1 + --zone=us-central1-a

Release level
Release Level refers to the command’s release status.

Example: alpha for alpha commands, beta for beta commands, no release level needed for GA commands.

Component
Component refers to the different Google Cloud services.

Example: compute for Compute Engine, app for App Engine, etc.

Entity
Entity refers to the plural form of an element or collection of elements under a component.

Example: disks, firewalls, images, instances, regions, zones for compute

Operation
Operation refers to the imperative verb form of the operation to be performed on the entity.

Example: Common operations are describe, list, create/update, delete/clear, import, export, copy, remove, add, reset, restart, restore, run, and deploy.

Positional args
Positional args refer to the required, order-specific arguments needed to execute the command.

Example: <INSTANCE_NAMES> is the required positional argument for gcloud compute instances create.

Flags
Flags refer to the additional arguments, --flag-name(=value), passed in to the command after positional args.

Example: --machine-type=<MACHINE_TYPE> and --preemptible are optional flags for gcloud compute instances create.
