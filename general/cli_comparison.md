Comparing the CLI commands of Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) involves looking at several factors like command structure, ease of use, and comprehensiveness. Each platform has its unique design and philosophy:

### 1. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) - `gcloud` CLI**
- **Structure:** GCP's `gcloud` CLI is part of the Google Cloud SDK and is structured around `gcloud [component] [command] [flags]`. This structure is consistent and hierarchical, making it relatively straightforward to understand how commands relate to each other.
- **Ease of Use:** It offers interactive tutorials within the CLI, which can be beneficial for new users. Autocomplete features and well-documented error messages also enhance user experience.
- **Comprehensiveness:** It provides extensive support for managing all aspects of Google Cloud, with additional components like `gsutil` for storage and `kubectl` for Kubernetes operations integrated into the same toolset.

### 2. **Microsoft Azure - `az` CLI**
- **Structure:** Azure CLI uses a flat command structure `az [group] [subgroup] [command] [parameters]`. This approach makes it easy to start using the CLI, as it often mirrors the structure of Azure's resource organization.
- **Ease of Use:** Azure CLI is known for its user-friendliness, with more emphasis on making commands intuitive. The `--help` documentation is robust and accessible directly in the CLI.
- **Comprehensiveness:** Azure CLI covers nearly all Azure services and features, with regular updates that coincide with new Azure offerings.

### 3. **Amazon Web Services (AWS) - `aws` CLI**
- **Structure:** AWS CLI follows a pattern similar to Azure, structured as `aws [service] [subservice] [action] [parameters]`. This makes it somewhat intuitive, though the vast number of services can make the CLI seem complex.
- **Ease of Use:** AWS CLI is powerful but can be overwhelming due to the sheer breadth of services and options available. However, it is highly scriptable and integrates well with other AWS tools and services.
- **Comprehensiveness:** It arguably has the most comprehensive command set, reflecting AWS's wide range of services and capabilities.

### Comparison and Conclusion
- **Structure:** Azure and AWS offer a somewhat similar flat structure that can be easier for beginners to grasp. GCP's hierarchical structure might be clearer once users are more familiar with the CLI.
- **Ease of Comprehension:** Azure CLI is often praised for its simplicity and ease of use, making it potentially the best choice for new users or those who value straightforward CLI interactions.
- **Comprehensiveness:** AWS CLI covers more services and configurations, which might be preferred by users needing detailed control over a wide array of services.

Ultimately, the "best" CLI depends on your specific needs, familiarity with the cloud platform, and the specific tasks you need to perform. Each CLI has its strengths and is designed to work seamlessly within its respective cloud environment.


Here's a comparison of GCP, Azure, and AWS CLI commands in terms of structure and ease of comprehension:

**Structure:**

* **AWS CLI:** Known for being powerful and dense, with a wide range of commands and options. However, it can be inconsistent in structure across different services, making it less intuitive for beginners.
* **Azure CLI:** Generally considered rich and easy to get started with. It offers a consistent structure with verb-noun format (e.g., `az vm create`). However, some might find it slightly more complex than necessary.
* **GCP CLI:** Praised for its clean and consistent structure. It follows a similar verb-noun format (e.g., `gcloud compute instances create`) and is known for being easy to learn and use.

**Ease of Comprehension:**

* **AWS CLI:** The dense structure and inconsistencies can make it challenging for beginners to understand and remember commands. 
* **Azure CLI:** The clear structure and built-in help make it easier to grasp the commands and their functionalities.
* **GCP CLI:** The clean structure, consistent naming conventions, and helpful auto-completion features contribute to its reputation for being the most user-friendly CLI among the three.

**In summary:**

* **For experienced users:** AWS CLI offers the most power and flexibility.
* **For beginners:** GCP CLI is generally considered the easiest to learn and use due to its clear structure and helpful features.
* **For a balance:** Azure CLI provides a good balance between ease of use and functionality.

Ultimately, the best choice depends on your experience and priorities. It's recommended to try all three CLIs to see which one suits you best.
